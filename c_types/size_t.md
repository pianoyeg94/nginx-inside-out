Alias for `long unsigned int` (64 bits on 64-bit platforms, 32 bits on 32-bit platforms).

The `size_t` type is used to represent the size of objects in memory.
As examples, it is the type of the return value of the `sizeof` operator, and of the `strlen` function. 
Its specific size is platform-dependent; the size is chosen to be large enough to represent all sizes on that platform.
